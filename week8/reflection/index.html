            This class was my very first exposure to web development and I enjoyed it very much. Web development to me seems to have the right mix of creativity and 
            technical problem solving that I enjoy. My goal for a web development career is to work from home; I want to be able to live anywhere I please but still 
            have a career. When I attempt to enter the workforce in this field, I am not going to be picky where I work, I just want to gain experience because most 
            companies are looking for people with experience. I would even consider an unpaid internship. Eventually, I would prefer to work for a stable company with 
            a solid long-term plan.

            I plan on building my current traits and skills during the program by doing more extracurricular activities and really honing my skills as well as starting 
            to network with people in the feild. There are many great resources out there and want to take advantage of everything I can to make me stand out to future 
            potential employers. The assignment I enjoyed most was the capstone project. I was lucky enough to chat with a real business owner about what he would want 
            in a website. I felt like this was a preview of what a career in web development could be like and I had a lot of fun doing the project.  The capstone was 
            also my biggest accomplishment; I am amazed that after starting with no knowledge of web development and after just 8 weeks what I can do now.

            After going through this first course, I have a better understanding of what it will take to be a web developer and I feel confident that I will do well in 
            it. Of course, there is still a lot for me to learn but this is how I feel so far.  What I have learned so far will apply well to my future goal of working 
            in the web development field remotely. I am excited to be here and to be learning something new for my future!
